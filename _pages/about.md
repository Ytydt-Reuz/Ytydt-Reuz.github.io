I am currently a senior student pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [College of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.cup.edu.cn/cupai/), China University of Petroleum, Beijing, China, advised by [Yuanfeng Lian](https://www.cup.edu.cn/ai/szdw/js2/33ea9e1973144b879cfce55616645f72.htm). Currently applying for graduate school admission.

Research
======
I'm interested in unmanned Intelligent Systems, motion and path planning, mobile manipulators, robot vision, and quadruped robot. Most of my research experience is about enabling mobile robots move intelligently and finish challenging tasks.
